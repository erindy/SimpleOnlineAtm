# SimpleOnlineAtm

This application is a simple online ATM machine which performs just a few operations, however the backend code adheres to the best practices of asp.net MVC. This is was a personal project which I developed for learning purposes.

This application uses identity so at first you have to register in order to use it.

You can:
  - You can see your atm account details (balance, id, accountnumber)
  - You deposit money and make a transaction
  - Display all your transcations
